# Google Shopping - Conditionals and Loops

We'll be using a file represented as **JSON** for this assignment. JSON is a standard for formatting data, and it's a common format you'll see throughout your web development career. Even more important will be parsing JSON.

This large object is in the products file. It is the kind of object you would really recieve from google shopping.

## Getting Started
Write your solutions in the `ruby/google-shopping.rb` file.

## Deliverables

Use the product search result in your file to find the following results. Note that you may want to comment out your solutions as you solve them, to avoid a mess of output in the console.

1.) Go through the `items` and find all results that have `kind` of `shopping#product`. Print the count of these results. Where else is this count information stored in the search results?

2.) Print the `title` of all items with a `backorder` availability in `inventories`.

3.) Print the `title` of all items with more than one image link.

4.) Print all "Canon" products in the items (careful with case sensitivity).

5.) Print all `items` that have an author name of "eBay" and are brand "Canon".

6.) Print all the products with their **brand**, **price**, and an **image link**
